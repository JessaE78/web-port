                <p>If you're reading this, hello! Welcome to my webpage! Here's a glimpse of who I am:
                </p>

                <p> I am a third year undergraduate student at the University of Central Florida. Currently, I'm studying to get my Bachelor's of
                    Science in Computer Engineering. I have a background in Network Administration and Troubleshooting, and have earned a few industry-standard
                    certifications to reflect my knowledge. I also have some experience in web development and working on software projects with a team of
                    people. 
                </p>
                <p> Despite my experience in Information Technology and Software Development, I am passionate in getting involved with the hardware side of things.
                    I am an active member in the Institute of Electronics Engineers (IEEE) chapter at my university and the Software Director of the Project
                    Committee.

                </p>
